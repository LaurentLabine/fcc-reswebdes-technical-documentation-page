# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation page

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

It is accessible here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-technical-documentation-page/

And answers the technical requirements stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page
